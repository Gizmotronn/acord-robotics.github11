# Manacaster 
Our team numbers have swelled to 4 for the development of Manacaster, and that's just one of the things that we'll be talking about in today's post about the development of our blockbuster game.

While Manacaster only started development in 2019, we've been working on the novel that Manacaster is based on - Star Sailors - for a number of years now (check out the "further reading" section at the bottom of this page.

While we were writing Star Sailors, we gradually began to ask ourselves how we were going to write the storyline for the game, as well as what the game would actually be. I've always been a big fan of open-world sandbox games, so just being Opus and following the storyline from the original Star Sailors never appealed to me (at least, not for the first game. There will be mini-games and prequel scenes in Manacaster in the near future that will be like this). We quickly decided that getting a script for the characters in the game would be the best way to show the team what the game would be like, and we resolved to start working on it as soon as we finished Star Sailors: Earthlings.
