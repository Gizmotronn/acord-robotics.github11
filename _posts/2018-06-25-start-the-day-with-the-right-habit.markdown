Dashboards are a very big project to undertake, but they're also something very important to AC0/RD. In this post, I'll talk about what dashboards are and how ours will work.

# What are HTML Dashboards?
For developers coming from content management systems like Wordpress, Drupal & Joomla, the dashboard may sound like the "backend" of a website, and it commonly is, even with static site generators like Bootstrap. Bootstrap consists of a front-end, which is composed on html, css & javascript, and the individual files for that make up the site (which may be hosted on a service like Github). 

In the case of a CMS, the dashboard allows you to track & manage things like:

* Comments
* Blog posts
* User accounts
* Site performance
* Store sales
* App performance
* Survey results
* & more...

On wordpress, the dashboard is all set up and ready to go as soon as you install wordpress on your server/host. With bootstrap, it's a bit different.

> A dashboard usually consists of graphical representations of the current status and trends within an organization.
