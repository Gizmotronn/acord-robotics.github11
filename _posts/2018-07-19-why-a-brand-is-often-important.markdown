We live in a world where we have god-like powers. 20 years ago, these powers were in a large number of corporate buildings and in an increasingly large amount of personal households, however very rarely did people take these powers with them wherever they went. Fast forward to 2020, and we have access to every source of news, limitless entertainment and endless productivity tools to ensure that we never suffer a dull moment. 

It's very rare that there is an item that everyone takes everywhere with them. Clothes? Yep. Glasses? Yep. Your phone?

20 years ago, the responses would have been mixed. A phone was just that - a phone. No social media, no graphically-intensive games. While "smartphones" like the Blackberry did exist, their market share was small and their target audience was predominantly business people. Go back even further, to the first decade of mobile phones, and even less people considered the mobile phone a neccessity, and less people would carry it with them everywhere they went. 

Now, the importance of being able to play God wherever we are is rising. And the number of people who are playing God is also rising. Everywhere you go around Europe, Australia, or America, you will see people of all ages navigating the virtual world, one finger swipe at a time.

If you have a website, you may have once considered creating a native app for your website (especially if your site has lots of visitors). So have we! However, creating native apps for iOS & Android can be hard if you don't know what you're doing, and on top of that expensive. 

# The cost of making an app
If you know how to program an app, you only need to pay for the licensing fees with Google & Apple. For example, to create an app for iOS and publish it on the App Store, you need to have an Apple Developer License, which costs $99 a year. 

A lot of companies have decided to avoid the hastle of hiring a developer or making the app from scratch, and thus there have been a number of companies like Appypie, Mobiroller & Wordapp that have sprung to close this gap in the market. For a small fee, you can use a drag-and-drop interface to create your own app, with a number of customizable modules. The good thing about this is that it is easy and fast to do. The problem is that this can add to the cost.

On top of having to pay to upload your apps to the app store/play store, you also need to pay your App Maker a monthly fee. If you want to have support for HTML5, iOS & Android, it may be $25/month. You want to put your own ads in there, or remove them (many app makers put their own ads into your app to make money) - another $15/month. And there's no way to get access to the source code of your app when you go with this solution.

To make it worse, the service you use will typically manage the publishing of your application to the App Store. They will actually charge you more for them to do it then it would cost for you to do it yourself. For small businesses, or for websites by individuals, creating a native app can be a costly (both in terms of money and time) initiative. 

By all means, if none of this bothers you you're free to keep using services like Appypie, or to make your own native apps. There is no disadvantage with having a native app, especially if you're a big company. Everyone knows how to download apps onto their devices today. But if you want to have most of the advantages of a native app without the cost, there is a solution. It's called a "Progressive Web App". Be warned: while it is cheaper to make, unless you get someone else to do it for you it is a *lot* of work.
