We live in a world where we have god-like powers. 20 years ago, these powers were in a large number of corporate buildings and in an increasingly large amount of personal households, however very rarely did people take these powers with them wherever they went. Fast forward to 2020, and we have access to every source of news, limitless entertainment and endless productivity tools to ensure that we never suffer a dull moment. 

It's very rare that there is an item that everyone takes everywhere with them. Clothes? Yep. Glasses? Yep. Your phone?

20 years ago, the responses would have been mixed. A phone was just that - a phone. No social media, no graphically-intensive games. While "smartphones" like the Blackberry did exist, their market share was small and their target audience was predominantly business people. Go back even further, to the first decade of mobile phones, and even less people considered the mobile phone a neccessity, and less people would carry it with them everywhere they went. 

Now, the importance of being able to play God wherever we are is rising. And the number of people who are playing God is also rising. Everywhere you go around Europe, Australia, or America, you will see people of all ages navigating the virtual world, one finger swipe at a time.
